-- 4th problem
{-
  This implementation receives no argument, and if evaluated will throw
  an exception. Function can be used in the general sense without evaluation.
  For example, evaluating:
  > length [undefined', undefined']
  will output '2'.
  Call doesn't crash because function itself is not evaluated, but merely
  used for 'lazy count.'
-}
undefined' :: a
undefined' = error "Can not be evaluated"

{-
  This implementation receives no argument, and returns function (itself).
  Function returned than also recieves no argument, resulting in infinite
  loop of recursive calls.
