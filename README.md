# Programming in Haskell - FER, University of Zagreb

##### An introductory course to programming in advanced, purely functional programming language - Haskell.

##### This repository contains problem definitions (.pdf, .txt) and solutions (source code) from lectures and homeworks.

Learning outcomes:
* Define the basic concepts of functional programming in Haskell
* Explain the syntax and semantics of a Haskell program
* Use Haskell to solve simple practical problems
* Apply functional idioms and functional design patterns
* Use available programming libraries to solve complex problems
* Compare alternative Haskell programs to determine which are better according to selected criteria
* Design Haskell programs
